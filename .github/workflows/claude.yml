            Review this Next.js/React/TypeScript pull request focusing on:

            **Code Quality & Correctness**
            - TypeScript type safety and proper type definitions
            - React best practices (hooks, component patterns, performance)
            - Next.js specific patterns (SSR, SSG, API routes, routing)

            **Performance & Optimization**
            - Bundle size impact and code splitting
            - React rendering optimizations (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
            - Next.js Image and Script optimization usage
            - Unnecessary re-renders or expensive computations

            **Security**
            - XSS vulnerabilities in React components
            - API route security and validation
            - Environment variable handling
            - Third-party dependency risks

            - Test coverage for new/changed functionality
            - Component testability and mocking patterns
            - Code readability and maintainability
            - Proper error handling and edge cases

            **UI/UX & Accessibility**
            - Radix UI component usage and patterns
            - Tailwind CSS best practices
            - Responsive design considerations
            - Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML)

            **Architecture & Patterns**
            - Component structure and reusability
            - State management patterns
            - API integration patterns
